# electron-browser-shell

A bare-bones, tabbed web browser with support for Chrome extensionsâ€”built on Electron.

This is a WIP testbed for development of Chrome extension support in Electron. Minimal dependencies are used as a means to allow developers to take what they need for their own projects.
